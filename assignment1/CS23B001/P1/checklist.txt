Checklist for Assignment P1

1) Have you tarred + gzipped the file as XXXXXXXX.P1.tar.gz (your 8-digit roll number) or zipped it to XXXXXXXX.tgz?
    Yes
2) Does your tar.gz / .tgz file expand (by using the command tar xvzf) to the base directory named XXXXXXXX (your 8-digit roll number), with sub directory named PY within it, and which in turns contains all your files?
    Yes
3) Have you removed the a.out files and other generated files from your tar ball?
    Yes
4) Does the above created P1 contains P1.y, P1.l, that can be compiled using bison -d P1.y; flex P1.l; g++ P1.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl -o P1?
    Yes
5) Does your generated P1 take input from Standard Input (for usage of redirection) ?
    Yes
6) Does your generated P1 write output to Standard Output (for usage of redirection) ?
    Yes
7) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output?
    Yes
8) Is (some part of) the assignment plagiarized? 
    I have used my indent function from the c-beautify lab (the function was my brainchild anyways, but just mentioning.) I also came to know there is something like the regex replace when it came up in a conversation about this assignment, I discovered and used it on my own though.
9) Any comments about your evaluation strategy :
    Seems fair, apart form the part where some of the testcases were ambiguous or a little wrong with grammar.
